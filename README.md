# Twitter Clone

`This app is a copy of Twitter`

This application allows to use CRUD, in regards to Tweets. As well as following and unfollowing other users, there is also the possibility of giving likes to your own or someone else's Tweets. The application was designed in a Responsive way, both for Cell Phones, Tablets or Computers.

`In summary, the application is similar to what the original Twitter would be.`

In the `Back End`, `Node.js` was used, and it was complemented with NPM, Express for general operation,
-Persist so that when reloading the page you don't have to log in repeatedly.
-Bcryptjs to encrypt user passwords, Great for user creation.
-JWT for user authentication.

In the `Front End`, `React.js` has been used mainly to obtain a full and functional dynamism.
-For a better operation and development `Redux` has been used.
-Axios has been used to make calls to the Back End.
-The design was done using `CSS` and `Bootstrap` mainly.

`MongoDB` has been used for data storage, there are two collections, Users and Tweets. Users and Tweets data was populated with https://fakerjs.dev/. Currently the database has 10 users and 100 tweets that are interlinked and with a random number of likes, and follow and followers.
